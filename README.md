# Discrete Signal Processing - DSP


* **Anthropology**: Biomechanics --> Patients' gait study and MATLAB simulation
* **EMG**: ElectroMyoGraphy --> Muscle activity study
* **Physiological signals**: Vital signs --> Study of some vital signs (Heart Rate, Respiration Rate, etc) to analyze patients' conditions.
* others: first projects I worked on to get started in Discrete Signals.
